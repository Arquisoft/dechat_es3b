== Design Decisions

=== Language
Among the following three languages:
* Java
* C#
* AngujarJS (JavaScript)
We have decided that the best language is JavaScript since the other two languages (Java and C #) do not have direct support of Solid and it would be us who would have to implement a controller that communicates with SOLID. However, the disadvantage of JavaScript is that we need a level that no member of the team currently has. Despite this, among all we have seen that the best option is to use JavaScript.

=== Database
For the moment we will not use any database because we do not see it necessary. As the project progresses, if we see that the project requires a database, we will use a relational database such as MySQL, as we have used them in other subjects and we already have some experience with them.
