=== Quality Scenarios

[options="header",cols="1,2,3"]
|===
| *Quality attributes* | *Scenario* | *Priority*
| Functional suitability | The application must correctly meet the minimum requirements for a conversation to take place between two users| High, high
| Usability | The application must be easy to understand and use to satisfy the user| High, medium
| Efficiency | The sending of messages must be correctly reaching the receiver in reasonable times | High, medium
| Testability | The application must pass unit tests and integration tests correctly | High, medium
| Maintainability | 
Ensuring continuous improvement against errors, unexpected component failures and new requirements | Medium, high
| Securability | Require each user to identify themselves in order to use the application and allow them to control who has access to their data | Medium, medium
| Scalability | Although the number of users increases, the application will continue to operate with the same efficiency| Medium, medium
|===

Priority defines the importance of the quality attribute for our application, it is measured in three levels (high, medium, low) which in turn also have three levels. 
For example, high high is the highest priority while high medium would be somewhat lower but not as high as medium high.
